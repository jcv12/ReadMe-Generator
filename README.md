  ## Description
  This is a Node.js command line prompt program using inquirer to gather information from the user to produce a custom markdown file
 . My motivation for creating this project was to practice and show my skills in Node. The application is designed to create read-me files that look professional and asethetic without having to remember all of the markdown syntax. Users who use this will have to just import there screenshot or video by hand but the program allows for space if the user selects "yes" when prompted.
